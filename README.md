# Yanthram Studio - Angular

## About the application
 This application is a low code platform to accelerate the initial development time rapidly by offering mostly used Angular components. These leaf level functional and page level components are independent functional units are to be used with any existing Angular based application. The exported output of this application can be a single or multiple components of a specific version. The offerings are developer centric and intended to help the developers to quickly have a component code generated and used in their applications that can be used as a base and further worked on by fine tuning the details or extend the functionality, as required.

 The application provides a playground which is a WYSIWYG enabling user to drag and drop the UI components onto it. The configuration section enables the user to configure the selected component's functional behavior, data source, styling aspects, localisation etc. Once the configuration is tuned as required, user can export the component. This step generates the metadata in JSON format, which is further used by the internal code generator to produce and export the code as angular component.

 This project itself is built in Angular and the components that are configured in the playground are exported as-is. This is greatest feature of this application as the user will not only get the same experience and functionality that he experienced on the first hand, but also the same code that is behind that experience.

 ## Live app
  The application is deployed here for use.. 

## It's Story
 This Project is an evolving story to build a low code platform that is developer centric and is very generic. The intention is to build a platform that would help the developers in their daily development with no strings attached. While this project was developed to help to serve as a testimonial of my portfolio outside my professional work. Added is my desire to contribute something to the developer community, in my own way.

 The idea started from my experiences as part of job, architecting and developing multiple projects that also includes low code platform and integration of 3rd party accelerators. During my exploration. As I see, most of the developers have troubles starting clean slate and the momentum is slow in the begining of each major component development, accumulating the initial delays. On the other hand, they are fast to complete I have always felt that most of the low code platforms were mostly business centric and not developer centric. Additionally, few of the platforms that claim to offer rapid development, will eventually tie the org/developers to stay on their platform for the lifetime of development and sometimes event for hosting too. If not, they are economically not viable for all the organizations. 
 
 The output of this project shall be made available to developers to consume in their applications for free, to serve as a base and further modify for handling any business specific complexities.

## Tech Stack
 This application was initially built on Angular v16.1 and will be constantly updated to the latest version of angular. While the studio application uses mainly Angular Material UI and other JS libraries, the components exported can either be using Angular Material or any other library, if and as required by that component.
 All the modules of the application, the editor, code - generator and the packager are written Javascript/Angular.

## License
 While this studio application code is owned by me, and is not encouraged to consume or use in any way, directly. However, the output of this studio application deployed here, which are the Angular components are completely free to use or modify.
